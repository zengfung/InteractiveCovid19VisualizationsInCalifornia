## Data Visualization and Interactive Plot on COVID-19 Cases in California

Disclaimer: <br>
* `covid0.R` was provided to me by Prof. Duncan Temple Lang.
* COVID-19 data is obtained from the New York Times.

The goal of this project is to build interactive plots using `plotly` and then tinkering the HTML files (if necessary) by editing/writing Javascript functions.

Note: Due to the large file size of the interactive map on COVID-19 cases, the related HTML files are not uploaded. The closest possible animation that could be uploaded is the GIF below.
